    <h1>Welcome to My Web HQ!</h1>
    <h2>About the Man: Benjamin Kitko</h2>
    <p>You have now entered into the beginnings of a realm filled with cyber defense, music, and video games. For cyber
        defense here is a
        reminder that you might find helpful -- changing from the default credentials within your computer or IoT
        (Internet of Things) devices to a difficult-to-guess password or passkey made by you will greatly increase your
        internet cybersecurity defense posture. For music guitar is my forte but a
        keyboard cannot be too far away for when inspiration strikes. For video games both the Nintendo 3DS and Switch 2
        are some of the first systems I
        gravitate towards. One of my other interests is learning about and photographing many different Maryland
        wildlife
        creatures.</p>
    <h2>A Small Handful of Cyber Safety Tips</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Long passwords that contain phrases known only by the password creators can lead to better memorization and
            less of a need to write down credentials.</li>
        <li>Enabling file extensions within the file systems of your computer could prevent the accidental activation of
            an unknown program that disguised itself as a different file.</li>
        <li>Having multiple antivirus or anti-malware applications active on a computer might seem extra safe, but it is
            not entirely necessary and can cause a computer to slow down quicker.</li>
        <li>Cookies are delicious, but stale cookies can ruin both appetite and login sessions -- good practice allows
            for clearing all cookies now and again.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>New Linux Adventurers</h2>
    <p>Looking to begin the journey into the world of Linux but not quite sure how yet? Trying a Linux distro (operating
        system
        distribution) on a vm (virtual machine) is a good starting point. Give <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VirtualBox" target="_blank"
            alt="link to Wikipedia VirtualBox info">VirtualBox</a> a go. Oracle keeps the free
        and
        open-source (FOSS) software updated and secured. With VirtualBox or another vm like VMWare Workstation Pro
        (Windows) or VMWare Fusion (Mac), Qemu, or Xen those searching can download a complete Linux operating system
        (iso file) to test how they might like the feel and overall change of OS (operating system) pace. One place to
        <i>'shop'</i> around for Linux OSes might be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DistroWatch" target="_blank"
            alt="link to Wikipedia DistroWatch website info">DistroWatch</a> as an example. It contains long lists and
        categories of Linux and FreeBSD (Unix-based operating systems) where one can browse and learn more about
        available distros.
    </p>
    <p>Be sure to confirm the hash of any free software, and ensure that the download was from the actual source before
        running the software on your computer. Malware likes to sneak onto systems through haphazard clicks and blind
        direction-following. For Windows systems a yellow pop-up with an unknown author or source upon clicking or
        activating an installer (usually ending in the extension ".exe") means that the download might be risky if
        continued.</p>
    <h2>For Employers</h2>
    <p>I am enthusiastic that you have reached here. This is only a small sample of my capabilities and skills in the
        Information Technology and Cybersecurity arenas. I am looking forward to seeing where our business relationship
        will take us. Thank you for visiting my webpage.</p>
